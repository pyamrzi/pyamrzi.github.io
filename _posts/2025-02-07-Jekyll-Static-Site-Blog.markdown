For my first project, I am developing this static site on Github Pages. I will record any and all major changes to the site on this post.

To start, I created the site using the [Jekyll for Github](https://github.com/ghosind/Jekyll-Paper-Github) theme. I then went on to edit the SCSS files. (*2/9/2025*)
