I have recently begun a teaching assistantship for my **Embedded Biomedical Instrumentation** class. This class taught me all of the basics of embedded systems and it expanded my basic knowledge of electronics. 


In addition to this, I had recently invested a great sum of money to camera, audio, and lighting equipment. I bought this equipment so that I may release anything that I have learned in a much more digestible manner. I feel that this is necessary as there is so much to learn and so much of it is difficult to understand. Additionally, this will push me to learn more about the topics I am interested in.


Hence, I am hoping to perform the best that I can in this assistantship, as it is a great opportunity for me to test out my camera equipment and refine my embedded systems skills.

Here is the first video that I have made for this class:
