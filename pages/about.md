Hi. I'm Pouya. 

I am a graduate Engineering student that enjoys learning about deep learning, image processing, embedded systems, bioeletronics, statistics, and much more. I am always coming up with new ideas, so I plan to start developing microprojects to slowly push myself towards bringing my ideas to reality.  I made this static site to act a hub for all of my microprojects.


This site was developed on Github Pages using the Jekyll Paper for Github Theme.
